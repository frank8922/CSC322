The difference between "wc `grep -l int *`" and "grep -l int * | wc"
is that the is the first uses command substitution to run the grep command. The grep command then searches every file (hence the '*') in the current directory for the string "int", the -l option prints only the file names. This output is then used by the wc command and will give you the word, line, and character count for each file that contains the words "int". The second uses the output from the "grep -l int *" command to pipe stdin for the wc command, the wc command then counts the words, lines, and characters generated by that output of that command.
